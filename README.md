# instacart-python-analysis
Python data analysis project exploring Instacart's customer behaviour and sales trends.

## ðŸ›’ Instacart Python Data Analysis Project 

  

### Overview 

  

This Python project was developed as part of a data analytics course and is based on a combination of publicly available data from Instacartâ€™s 2017 dataset (via Kaggle) â€” an online grocery delivery service â€” and fabricated customer data provided by CareerFoundry for training purposes. The main goal of this project was to explore customer behaviour and uncover insights to help the company improve its targeted marketing strategies. 

  

As a data analyst, I conducted a full cycle of data cleaning, wrangling, merging, and exploratory data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. 

  

### Objectives 

  

The project aimed to: 

- Understand Instacart customers through their order behaviours and demographic profiles. 

- Identify the most active shopping days and times to inform advertising schedules. 

- Group products into price ranges to help guide marketing efforts. 

- Determine product popularity and key differences between customer segments. 

- Support the development of customer profiles for more effective campaign targeting. 

  

### Key Business Questions Addressed 

  

- What are the busiest days and hours for Instacart orders? 

- When do customers spend the most money? 

- Which types of products and departments are most popular? 

- How does customer loyalty relate to purchasing habits? 

- Are there differences in behaviour across customer demographics, such as age, income, region, and family status?
